# Hepatitis-C-Virus-Classification
Prediction or Classification of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) from laboratory values of blood Donors and Hepatitis C patients

This project aims to look at the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and predict possible future occurrence based on the samples collected. This prediction will help forecast the future occurrence of the disease based on blood samples.

# Objectives of the project
The goals of the project are to:
1. Explore the chosen datasets using exploratory data analysis to gain insights and guide on the statistical model and machine learning algorithm to be adopted.
2. Create additional data attributes based on the existing ones. Explore all the datasets to gain further insights and explore the impact of combining two data attributes.
3. Predict the occurrence of Hepatitis C Virus based on the attributes of the data collected.
