# Hepatitis-C-Virus-Classification
Prediction or Classification of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) from laboratory values of blood Donors and Hepatitis C patients
Hepatitis C virus is a virulent health problem that is prevalent across the world. According to Te and Jensen (2010), HCV is up to 5 times more contagious than Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and requires less contact than HIV to cause ailment. The 2017 European region report of the World Health Organisation confirms there is no vaccine against the Hepatitis C Virus. The dreadful disease demands to be addressed with solid identification, diagnosis, treatment, and prediction for future occurrences.
Jabbar, Samreen, and Aluvalu (2018) reported that various advancements in the Machine Learning field allow the conception and creation of innovative technologies that can fast-track the identification and diagnosing of diseases and even optimize the treatments. This project investigates and predicts the occurrence of hepatitis from laboratory values of blood donors and Hepatitis C patients. Various tools within the area of Data Science can be applied in tandem with gender, demographics, lifestyle, among other factors, to derive insights about specific diseases and previous patients to the diagnosis of chronic disease. Chase has described, 2018 that Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence pipelines can investigate and continually learn from different data sources. Machine learning algorithm outcomes can support diagnostic pathways employed by medical experts Hoffmann et al. 2018.

This project aims to look at the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and predict possible future occurrence based on the samples collected. This prediction will help forecast the future occurrence of the disease based on blood samples.

# Objectives of the project
The goals of the project are to:
1. Explore the chosen datasets using exploratory data analysis to gain insights and guide on the statistical model and machine learning algorithm to be adopted.
2. Create additional data attributes based on the existing ones. Explore all the datasets to gain further insights and explore the impact of combining two data attributes.
3. Predict the occurrence of Hepatitis C Virus based on the attributes of the data collected.
